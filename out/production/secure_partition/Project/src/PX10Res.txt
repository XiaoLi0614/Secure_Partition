    Notes:
        blockCyclic is not supported in v2 anymore. In linpack, changed blockCyclic to block. Validates.
        Do not use "val" as a variable name. Happened in linpack, plasma and sparsemm.
        Do not use "at". Happened in raytracer.

        The current coding of the benchmark does not work with the current version because
        the current version copies everything that is captured. So when we write back to a
        field with a backward async, we are writing to a copy and the original field remains unchanged!
        We need to change the benchmark to use GlobalReferences. See 185-192 pages of the following
        http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/documentation/languagespec/x10-latest.pdf
